# ClearBallot System Demo Instructions

*Updated for Service-Oriented Architecture - August 2025*

## 🎯 **Demo Overview**

ClearBallot now features a **service-oriented architecture** with two primary applications that demonstrate the complete election workflow. Both applications use the same underlying ServiceClient API, showcasing the modern architecture while maintaining user-friendly interfaces.

### **Demo Applications**
1. **ElectionAdmin.exe** - Election administration and setup
2. **VoterInterface.exe** - Voter registration and voting experience
