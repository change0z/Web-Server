## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

#### Windows
- CMake 3.10 or higher
- Visual Studio 2022 with C++17 support
- Git for Windows

#### Linux (Arch-based distributions)
- CMake 3.10 or higher
- GCC 7+ or Clang 5+ with C++17 support
- Git
- Make or Ninja build system

```bash
# Install dependencies on Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S cmake gcc git make

# Or with Clang
sudo pacman -S cmake clang git make
```

### Building the System

#### Windows (PowerShell/CMD)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/change0z/Web-Server.git
cd Web-Server/VotingSystem

# Build with CMake
cmake .
cmake --build .

# Test the service architecture (optional)
cd Debug && .\ServiceTest.exe
```

#### Linux (Arch-based)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/change0z/Web-Server.git
cd Web-Server/VotingSystem

# Configure build
cmake .

# Build the project
make

```

## üéÆ Usage Options

ClearBallot offers **two usage patterns** to accommodate different needs:

### **Option 1: Traditional Console Applications (Current)**
Use the existing console interfaces for immediate election management:
- `ElectionAdmin.exe` - Election administration
- `VoterInterface.exe` - Voter registration and voting
- `VotingSystem.exe` - Combined interface (legacy)

### **Option 2: Service-Based Architecture (New)**
Use the modern service layer for enhanced capabilities:
- **ServiceTest.exe** - Test and demonstrate service functionality
- **Service API** - For custom applications and future web/mobile interfaces
- **Concurrent Elections** - Manage multiple elections simultaneously
